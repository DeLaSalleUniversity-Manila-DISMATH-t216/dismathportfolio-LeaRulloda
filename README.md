# My DISMATH Portfolio

##Week 1
- I was introduced to the course DISMATH, which is quite different from my other mathematics subjects for it deals with logic, algorithms, proofs, and other things I’m yet to learn.
- On our first week of classes, I learned that there are different kinds of truth such as legal, authoritative, scientific, probable, and philosophical truth. What we’re trying to learn in this course is the **mathematical proof** which is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms.
- I learned symbols such as:

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Logical Expression | Value |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: | :-------: |
| ¬ |Negation | not | ¬p | opposite |
| ∧ | Conjunction | and | p ∧ q | minimum |
| v | Disjunction | or | p v q | maximum |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | xor |  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) | T iff exactly one of p and q is T, otherwise F|
| → | Conditional | if, then | p → q ≡  ¬p v q | F if p is T and q is F, otherwise T |
| ↔ | Biconditional | iff |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |  T iff p and q have the same truth values |

- I learned proving by using a truth table. The number of rows in a truth table is determined by the equation **rows = 2n** where n is the number of variables.
- I learned the **Implication Equivalence** which states that p → q ≡ ¬p v q.
- In a conditional statement for example p → q, I learned that p is called the **antecedent** and q the **consequent**.

##Week 2
- I learned some logical equivalences,
